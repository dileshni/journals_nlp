This has permitted quantifiable results to be obtained, (which are hypothetically derived without emperical observations), without having to wait for conflicts and/or accidents to determine the effectiveness of a system. The method was used to compare differences in the priority rules New Zealand had before and after the Traffic Regulations were altered on 1 February 1977. Ways in which uncertainty can be reduced are discussed with control signs being suggested, in conjunction with complementary signs on the main road, as extremely beneficial additions to the roadway environment.</p></abstract><self-uri content-type="pdf" ns1:href="YYST0020B/00014575/V0010I04/78900337/main.pdf" xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Full-text PDF</self-uri><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/0001-4575(78)90033-7</article-id><article-id pub-id-type="archive">thomson#1978#313#333#g</article-id><elocation-id content-type="archive">thomson#1978#313#333#g</elocation-id></article-meta><notes /></front></journal>
