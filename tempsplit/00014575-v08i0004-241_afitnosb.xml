It was found that most people accept that seat belts are effective, despite the fact that a large majority usually or always drive with belts unfastened. This failure to use seat belts appeared to result primarily from a failure to acquire the habit of buckling up. It did not reflect distrust of seat belts or any very deep-seated systems of attitudes and beliefs. It was concluded that public-education programs will not increase use of seat belts, but that measures are called for which take the decision to wear a belt out of the hands of individual drivers and passengers.</p>				</sec>			</abstract>		<elocation-id content-type="archive">knapper#1976#241#246#c</elocation-id></article-meta>		<notes>			<fn-group>				<fn>					<label>&#9734;</label>					<p>&#8224;This study was supported by funds provided by the Department of Transport of the Government of Canada.
